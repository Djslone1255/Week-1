# Overview

this is a basic hello world program written in a programing launguage I do not understand because Visual Studio code would not compile C++

the program prints Hello World to the console

this was the demonstrate my knowledge of Visual studio code and c++. or at least it was until VSC decided it needed 50 diffrent depeandent extras in order to compile c++. I was forced to make this in Python, a programing lanugue I have no experence with, and am bothered by the lack of semicolons.

A short demonstration and explanation of this program is avaible on youtube
